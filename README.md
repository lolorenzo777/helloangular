# Helloangular

This repo was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.
It uses @angular/material rather than boostrap.

The aim of this repo is only to test angular with material following the youtube tuto (in French) [Angular from scratch ( A to Z )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYhAfgEwNWA)


```bash
## first install
nvm use 18.12.1
ng new helloangular --style=scss --skip-tests=true
ng add @angular/material
```

Use ``scss`` syntax and transpiler.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
